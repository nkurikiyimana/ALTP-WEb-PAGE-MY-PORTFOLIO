              <h3>Web development?</h3>
              <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet
                 (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing 
                 a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, 
                 electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which 
                 Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content 
                 development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network 
                 security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals,
                  "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building 
                  Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management 
                  systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical 
                  skills.For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams 
                  can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like 
                  Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only 
                  require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment 
                  to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
                   technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments
                    rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of 
                    Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and 
                    full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior 
                    and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal 
                    with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] 
                    developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one 
                    of the most used technologies ever.</p>

              <h3>Web design?</h3>
              <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production
                 and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic
                  design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code
                   and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine 
                   optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects
                    of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term 
                    "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the 
                    front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design 
                    partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. 
                    Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date 
                    with web accessibility guidelines.r sit amet..", comes from a line in

              <h3>Web development tools?</h3>
              <p>Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web developers 
                to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated 
                development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, 
                rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.

                Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in web browsers. 
                Most popular web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
                 Microsoft Edge and Opera,[1] have built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional 
                 add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers.
                
                Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML,
                 CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to
                  increasing demand from web browsers to do more,[2] popular web browsers have included more
                   features geared for developers.</p>

              <h3>Web application?</h3>
              <p>In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the 
                application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each 
                client locally. In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client 
                program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on
                 each user's personal computer. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application 
                 would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user
                  workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. In addition, 
                  both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound
                   to a particular computer architecture and operating system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications (Nowadays, native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues).[dubious â€“ discuss]

                In 1995, Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language 
                called JavaScript allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements 
                to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending
                 data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded 
                 scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation 
                 or showing/hiding parts of the page.[2]
